Framework behavior under four failure scenarios with varying device/zone failure rates: Little (0.05/0.02), Medium (0.10/0.05), Heavy (0.20/0.10), and None.
(a) On 45 Shakespeare speakers, the framework follows the “No Failure” trend under Little and Medium scenarios, reaching the same maximum accuracy.
(b) On 50,000 FEMNIST samples, heavier failures increase variance and instability, yet maximum accuracy is maintained or exceeded.
(c) On CIFAR100, even minor failures prevent the framework from reaching peak accuracy.
