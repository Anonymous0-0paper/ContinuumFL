Convergence-speedup (table):

Tab. x: Number of rounds needed to reach a specified accuracy threshold on different datasets as well as recording the speedup of ContinuumFL compared to baselines.

Fig. x: Accuracy trajectory of ContinuumFL across communication rounds, compared against baseline methods FedAvg, FedProx, HierFL and ClusterFL.
We illustrate how our approach achieves faster or comparably equal convergence and higher final accuracy relative to the baselines while reducing communication overhead by applying top-k compression.
We use different datasets for each scenario: (a) Shakespeare, (b) FEMNIST, (c) CIFAR100.
