Zone sensibility (3 images):

Fig. x: Varying the number of physical zones while fixing the number of devices, the performance of our framework changes.
We investigate the global model accuracy on (a) Shakespeare, (b) FEMNIST, (c) CIFAR100 setting [5, 10, 15] physical zones.
Generally our framework achieves higher accuracy if it is given more zones for the same amount of client devices.
